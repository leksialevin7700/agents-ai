🏨 VISITO -  AI-Powered Hotel Concierge & Booking System

Your smart hotel assistant — blending conversational AI, automation, and cloud technology to make guest experiences seamless from booking to checkout.

🌍 Real-World Problem
Hotels often face fragmented guest communication:

Guests have to call/email for room availability, booking, or queries.

Staff spends too much time answering repetitive questions.

Manual follow-ups for confirmations, updates, or cancellations lead to errors and delays.

This results in slower service, lower guest satisfaction, and reduced efficiency.


💡 Our Solution
We built an AI-powered hotel booking concierge that:

Talks like a real receptionist using OpenAI’s conversational API.

Handles bookings, availability checks, and FAQs automatically.

Uses n8n automation to send SMS/email confirmations in real-time.

Stores all booking data securely in MongoDB for easy scaling.

Integrates with a React frontend and Node.js backend for a smooth user experience.

⚙️ Tech Stack
| Layer             | Technology                                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**      | React.js (guest-facing booking & chat interface)                     |
| **Backend**       | Node.js + Express (API gateway & business logic)                     |
| **Database**      | MongoDB(scalable NoSQL database for bookings & guest profiles) |
| **AI**            | OpenAI API (natural language chatbot for guest interaction)          |
| **Automation**    | n8n (low-code workflows for booking confirmations, reminders)        |
| **Notifications** | Email/SMS via integrated APIs (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid)               |

🔄 System Flow
1. Guest initiates conversation via chatbot on the hotel’s website.
2. AI Concierge understands the intent (e.g., booking, cancellation, query).
3. Backend API fetches or updates booking details in DynamoDB.
4. n8n automation triggers confirmation & update notifications.
5. Guest receives instant SMS/email confirmation.

🚀 Key Features
✅ AI Chat Concierge — understands guest queries naturally.
✅ Automated Booking Confirmation — no manual follow-up needed.
✅ Real-Time Updates — guests get instant status changes.
✅ Scalable & Secure — built on AWS services.
✅ Multi-Channel Notifications — SMS + Email integration.

📌 How It Works (Technical Deep Dive)
Frontend (React) — Displays chat interface & booking forms, interacts with backend via REST API.

Backend (Node.js) — Acts as the main controller, routes guest queries to AI or database as needed.

AI Layer (OpenAI API) — Parses natural language into structured booking requests or FAQs.

Database (MongoDB) — Stores bookings, guest profiles, and transaction logs in a scalable NoSQL structure.

Automation (n8n) — Watches for booking events in DynamoDB, triggers workflows to send notifications via email/SMS APIs.

🎯 Why This Matters in the Real World
This system can:

Reduce receptionist workload by 40–60%

Increase booking conversion rates with instant replies

Improve guest satisfaction by offering 24/7 support

Eliminate human error in confirmation messages

💖 Team Notes
We believe this solution doesn’t just digitize hotel booking — it humanizes automation.
The AI assistant is trained to sound polite, helpful, and context-aware — making guests feel welcome even before they arrive.
